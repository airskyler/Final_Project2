# Final_Project2

-	A short description of my final project - 

Jessy Mullen

•	My user name for SQL is “root”
•	My password for a SQL is “airskyler&19790201”
•	I don’t see any bugs yet on my final project.


The thing that you should do for my final project is enter a data to the blank textbox and click the add information button to see,
if the data you enter in the textbox has displayed in a consignor table, album table or sales table. You can also delete the data,
if you click on the row inside the table and high light the row and click delete information button.  
I have created three JFrame with displaying three different table for each frame. 
Each table has blank textbox to enter a data and there is a add information button, delete button, clear button and exit button.


•	Just to let you know… if you click the Exit button on the JFrame with a consignor table, it will close the connection to the database. 

•	If you click on the exit button for the JFrame with album Table or sales Table… it will just close the JFrame and it won’t close the connection to the database.

•	If you click the clear button, it will just clear the textbox for the new data entry

•	For Received Date for album table, I used a current date  


I also have a combo button with a drop down list of Consignor ID in JFrame with an album table, 
which can be used to adding an album information about title, artist and selling price along with a Consignor ID of your choice 
to add the data in an album table. This same Consignor ID is also used in a consignor table which contains a consignor’s name, 
phone number and money owed to the consignor. By looking at the Consignor ID inside the tables of consignor table, 
album table and sales table, it will be easy for you to see how the data is related to each table.
